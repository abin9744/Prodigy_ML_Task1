# Prodigy_ML_Task1
# House Price Prediction
This project aims to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms using a linear regression model.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes two main files:

train.csv: This file contains the training data, including features (such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms) and the corresponding sale prices.
test.csv: This file contains similar features as the training data but does not include the sale prices. It will be used for evaluating the trained model.
